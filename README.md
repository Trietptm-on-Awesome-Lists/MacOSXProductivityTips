## What is this?
This is the companion repository to the [_Mac OSX Productivity Tips for Developers_ video course](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000007.do), which Tim Berglund and I recorded in partnership with O'Reilly Media.  It contains an outline of the chapters, links to tools, and other resources related to the techniques discussed in the videos.
